[//]: # Protocol is a step-by-step guide for beginners to use your method. This is akin to a recipe that teaches you how to prepare a dish. Just like in a recipe, tell the learners what ingridients they should prepare (material list*) and a list of actions in chronological order to excecute for the desired outcome.

[//]: # *\* If the material list is extensive, you may want to present it on a separate page. Make sure to direct learners to this list before they read the rest of the protocol.*

[//]: # Providing an example dataset/expected outcome is highly recommended. This is like the image of the final dish in a recipe book - it tells the learners what to expect and allows them to check their progress.

[//]: # If your method requires multiple days, you may choose to divide the steps by day 1, day 2 etc. to help the learner plan in advance.

## Step 1: Fix the cells

Add 250 &#956;l of 4% Paraformaldehyde into the well...

For example, you can link to a [question in FAQs](../method-details/faqs.md) or more details on this step in [method details](../method-details/method-details.md).

## Step 2:  Use an imperitive sentence to briefly describe step

Elaborate on this step. 

## Step n:  Confirm results (quality control)

At the end of this process, your results should look something like those in the [example data](dataset.md).

Look for these features to confirm that everything has gone according to protocol.
