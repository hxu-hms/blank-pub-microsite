# Protocol

Protocol is a step-by-step guide for beginners to use your method. This is akin to a recipe that teaches you how to prepare a dish. 

In a recipe, you should make sure to tell the learners what ingridients they should prepare (material list*) and a list of actions in chronological order to excecute for the desired outcome.

*\* If the material list is extensive, you may want to present it on a separate page. Make sure to direct learners to this list before they read the rest of the protocol.*

Providing an example dataset/expected outcome is highly recommended. This is like the image of the final dish in a recipe book - it tells the learners what to expect and allows them to check their progress.
