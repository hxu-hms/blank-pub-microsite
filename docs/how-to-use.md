# This website contains different types of documentation

1. [Overview](./overview.md) provides relevant background information on this method.

2. [Protocol](./protocol.md) outlines a step-by-step guide for beginners to execute this method. We recommend providing example dataset or expected outcome for major steps for learners to confirm their progress. 

*If there are experimental and computational components to the method, you may choose to present them on different pages under this section*

**First time users should start with Protocol to learn how to use this method**

3. [Technical References](./technical-reference.md) provides detailed documentation on the method. Different from Protocol, which showcases **one** way to use the method, technical reference provides the information another researcher would need to customize the method and adopt it into their own research. 

Protocol allows someone to *repeat* your process, while technical reference should equipt someone to *adapt* your method.

4. [FAQs](./faqs.md) lists common troubleshooting scenarios and their recommended solutions.
